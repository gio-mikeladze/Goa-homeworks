<h2>3.Scoring Goals</h2>
<p>A goal results when the ball enters the goalmouth and crosses the goal line. 
FIFA Law 12 covers the directives on unsporting and inflammatory behaviour.
That includes the regulations for football goal celebrations taken from the rule book</p>
<h2>4.Football Referee and Officials></h2>
<p>The match referee rules and regulations enforce the Laws of the Game. They officiate the most complex laws of the game.
Referees are also responsible for maintaining respect and sportsmanship from the players.
Note: As a rule, the maximum number of assistant referees per game is two (2).
The elite games will also have extra scrutiny in the form of a video assistant referee (VAR).</p>

<h2>5.Winning the Game</h2>
<p>The most basic regulation in our 10 rules for football is all about winning the game. 
You win the football match if you have scored more goals than your opposition at the end of play.
If neither of the teams score a goal, or both have the same number of goals, the match would end as a drawn game.
Some would go to penalties or be replayed at a later date to determine a winner.</p>
