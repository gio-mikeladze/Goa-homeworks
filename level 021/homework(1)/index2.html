            <strong><em>A bed is an item of furniture that is used as a place to sleep, rest, and relax.[1][2]
            Most modern beds consist of a soft, cushioned mattress on a bed frame. The mattress rests either on a solid base, often wood slats, 
            or a sprung base. Many beds include a box spring inner-sprung base, which is a large mattress-sized box containing wood and springs
            that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress. Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets 
            and cribs, to small beds for a single person or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two people. While most beds are 
            single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as the murphy bed, which folds into a wall, the sofa bed, which 
            folds out of a sofa, the trundle bed, which is stored under a low, twin-sized bed and can be rolled out to create a larger sleeping 
            area, and the bunk bed, which provides two mattresses on two tiers as well as a ladder to access the upper tier. Temporary beds 
            include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot. Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as 
            the hammock. Other beds are made specifically for animal
            Beds may have a headboard for resting against, and may have side rails and footboards. "Headboard only" beds may incorporate a "dust 
            ruffle", "bed skirt", or "valance sheet" to hide the bed frame. To support the head, a pillow made of a soft, padded material is 
            usually placed on the top of the mattress. Some form of covering blanket is often used to insulate the sleeper, often bed sheets, 
            a quilt, or a duvet, collectively referred to as bedding. Bedding is the removable non-furniture portion of a bed, which enables 
            these components to be washed or aired out.</em></strong>

        <p>
            <em><strong>A closet (especially in North American English usage) is an enclosed space, with a door, used for storage, particularly that of 
            clothes. Fitted closets are built into the walls of the house so that they take up no apparent space in the room. Closets are often 
            built under stairs, thereby using awkward space that would otherwise go unused.
            A piece of furniture such as a cabinet or chest of drawers serves the same purpose of storage, but is not a closet, which is an 
            architectural feature rather than a piece of furniture. A closet always has space for hanging, where a cupboard may consist only 
            of shelves for folded garments. Wardrobe can refer to a free-standing piece of furniture (also known as an armoire), but according 
            to the Oxford English Dictionary, a wardrobe can also be a "large cupboard or cabinet for storing clothes or other linen", including 
            "built-in wardrobe, fitted wardrobe, walk-in wardrobe, etc."[1]</strong></em>

            excess of US$46 billion in its fiscal year 2022.[7][8]
            the company was founded on January 25, 1964, as "Blue Ribbon Sports", by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and officially became Nike, 
            Inc. on May 30, 1971. The company takes its name from Nike, the Greek goddess of victory.[9] Nike markets its products under its own 
            brand, as well as Nike Golf, Nike Pro, Nike+, Nike Blazers, Air Force 1, Nike Dunk, Air Max, Foamposite, Nike Skateboarding and Nike 
            CR7.[10] The company also sells products under its Air Jordan brand and its Converse subsidiary. Nike also owned Bauer Hockey from

            equipment, the company operates retail stores under the Niketown name. Nike sponsors many high-profile athletes and sports teams

        <h2>adidas</h2>

            <strong><em>Adidas AG (German pronunciation: [ˈʔadiˌdas] ⓘ; stylized in all lowercase since 1949)[4] is a German athletic apparel and footwear 
            corporation headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. It is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the second 
            largest in the world, after Nike.[5][6] It is the holding company for the Adidas Group, which also owns an 8.33% stake of the football 
            club Bayern Munich,[7] and Runtastic, an Austrian fitness technology company. Adidas's revenue for 2018 was listed at €21.915 billion.[3]
            The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house. He was joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name 
            Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik ("Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory"). Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) 
            for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal 
            spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer 
            Olympics. In 1949, following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas's business rival.[1]
            The three stripes are Adidas's identity mark, having been used on the company's clothing and shoe designs as a marketing aid. 
            The branding, which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports for the equivalent of €1,600 and two bottles 
            of whiskey,[8][9] became so successful that Dassler described Adidas as "The three stripes company".[8][9]</em></strong>
