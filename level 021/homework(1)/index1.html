        <h2>football</h2>

            <strong><em>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football 
            generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include 
            association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand);
            Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); 
            International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying 
            degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".
            There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.
            [2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 
            19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion and cultural power of the British Empire allowed these 
            rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, 
            distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local 
            traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in England, becoming 
            the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to 
            become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]</em></strong>

            <strong><em>A football is a ball inflated with air that is used to play one of the various sports known as football. In these games, with some 
            exceptions, goals or points are scored only when the ball enters one of two designated goal-scoring areas; football games involve the 
            two teams each trying to move the ball in opposite directions along the field of play.
            The first balls were made of natural materials, such as an inflated pig bladder, later put inside a leather cover, which has given 
            rise to the American slang-term "pigskin". Modern balls are designed by teams of engineers to exacting specifications, with rubber or 
            plastic bladders, and often with plastic covers. Various leagues and games use different balls, though they all have one of the 
            following basic shapes</em></strong>

        <h2>basketball</h2>
        <img src="./images/basketball.jpg" height="700px" alt="basketball">
        <p>
            Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete 
            with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 
            18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team 
            from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth 
            three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point 
            free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional 
            period of play (overtime) is mandated.
            players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require 
            considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal 
            the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that 
            bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the 
            ball with both hands then resume dribbling.
            The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest
            is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are
            the shooting guard and the point guard, who implement the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays 
            (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
            Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States, basketball has 
            evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.[1][2] The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most 
            significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition[3][4] (drawing
            most of its talent from U.S. college basketball). Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental 
            championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic 
            Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. Each continent
            hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup.
            The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and women's Olympic basketball tournament feature top national teams from continental championships. 
            The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas the strongest 
            +European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.

            <strong><em>A basketball is a spherical ball used in basketball games. Basketballs usually range in size from very small promotional items that 
            are only a few inches (some centimeters) in diameter to extra large balls nearly 2 feet (60 cm) in diameter used in training exercises.
            For example, a youth basketball could be 27 inches (69 cm) in circumference, while a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) 
            men's ball would be a maximum of 30 inches (76 cm) and an NCAA women's ball would be a maximum of 29 inches (74 cm). The standard for 
            a basketball in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is 29.5 inches (75 cm) in circumference and for the Women's National 
            Basketball Association (WNBA), a maximum circumference of 28.5 inches (72 cm). High school and junior leagues normally use NCAA, 
            NBA or WNBA sized balls.[1][2]
            Aside from the court and the baskets, the basketball is the only piece of equipment necessary to play the game of basketball. 
            During the game, the ball must be bounced continuously (dribbling), thrown through the air to other players (passing) or thrown 
            towards the basket (shooting). Therefore, the ball must be very durable and easy to hold on to. The ball is also used to perform 
            tricks (sometimes called freestyling), the most common of which are spinning the ball on the tip of one's index finger, dribbling 
            in complex patterns, rolling the ball over one's shoulder, or performing aerobatic maneuvers with the ball while executing a slam 
            dunk, most notably in the context of a slam dunk contest.</em></strong>

        <img src="./images/UFC5.webp" height="700px">
        <p>
            <strong><em>EA Sports UFC 5 is a mixed martial arts fighting video game developed by EA Vancouver and published by EA Sports. 
            Serving as the sequel to EA Sports UFC 4 (2020), it was released on October 27, 2023 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
            Like its predecessor, UFC 5 is a fighting game based on the mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). 
            UFC 5 features a revamped damage system which allows the game to render blood and sweat realistically and show different combinations 
            of facial damages during combat. Injuries will impact a fighter's performance. For instance, a bruised eye may result in impaired 
            vision. If the player character is severely injured, the match will be temporarily paused or halted completely by a ring doctor.[1] 
            The grappling system is also streamlined, allowing players to initiate submission attempts faster and more seamlessly when compared with UFC 4.[2]
            The game features a career mode, which sees the return of Coach Davis introduced in UFC 4. The goal of the player is to become the 
            "G.O.A.T" (which stands for "greatest of all time"). The game also features an online career mode, in which player's own custom 
            characters fight against other characters created by other player, and a fight contract mode which generate a match with AI-controlled 
            fighers on a daily basis.[1]</em></strong>
