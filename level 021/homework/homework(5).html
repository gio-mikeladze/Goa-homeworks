            <strong><em>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/ ⓘ), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, 
            alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]
            Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers 
            and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
            javaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic 
            typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, 
            and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular 
            expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In 
            practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</em></strong>

                The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. The lead developers of Mosaic then 
                founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the 
                most-used.[12]
                During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the 
                page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995,
                Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun 
                Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]
                The goal was a "language for the masses",[13] "to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites".[14] Netscape 
                management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like 
                Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called 
                LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official 
                release in December.[6][1][15][16]
                The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com 
                boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.

        <h3>JavaScript engine</h3>

            <strong><em>
                The first engines for JavaScript were mere interpreters of the source code, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time 
                compilation for improved performance. JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major 
                browser has one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model 
                and Web IDL bindings. However, the use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers; for example, the V8 engine is a 
                core component of the Node.js runtime system. Since ECMAScript is the standardized specification of JavaScript, ECMAScript 
                engine is another name for these implementations. With the advent of WebAssembly, some engines can also execute this code in 
                the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.

        <h3>Runtime system</h3>
        <p>
            <strong><em>
                A JavaScript engine must be embedded within a runtime system (such as a web browser or a standalone system) to enable scripts 
                to interact with the broader environment. The runtime system includes the necessary APIs for input/output operations, such as 
                networking, storage, and graphics, and provides the ability to import scripts.
                JavaScript is a single-threaded language. The runtime processes messages from a queue one at a time, and it calls a function 
                associated with each new message, creating a call stack frame with the function's arguments and local variables. The call stack 
                shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. When the call stack is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as "run to completion" because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language's concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking: program I/O is performed using events and callback functions. This means, for example, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.[60]
                The notable standalone runtimes are Node.js, Deno, and Bun.
