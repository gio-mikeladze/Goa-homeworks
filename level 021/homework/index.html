            <i><b>The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was announced as the successor to 
            the PlayStation 4 in April 2019, was launched on November 12, 2020, in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, 
            and was released worldwide a week later. The PS5 is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles, along with Microsoft's Xbox 
            Series X/S consoles, which were released in the same month.
            The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The Digital Edition lacks this drive, as a lower
            -cost model for buying games only through download. The two variants were launched simultaneously. Slimmer hardware revisions of both 
            models replaced the original models on sale in November 2023.[10] A PlayStation 5 Pro model was released on November 7, 2024, featuring a faster GPU, improved ray tracing, and introducing an AI-driven upscaling technology.           
            The PlayStation 5's main hardware features include a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant 
            improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of 4K resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, hardware-accelerated 
            ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections, and the Tempest Engine for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects. Other features 
            include the DualSense controller with haptic feedback, backward compatibility with the majority of PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR 
            games, and the PlayStation VR2 headset.</b></i>

           <b><i> Television (TV) is a telecommunication medium for transmitting moving images and sound. Additionally, the term can refer to a physical 
            television set rather than the medium of transmission. Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports. 
            The medium is capable of more than "radio broadcasting," which refers to an audio signal sent to radio receivers.
            Television became available in crude experimental forms in the 1920s, but only after several years of further development was the new
            technology marketed to consumers. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in 
            the United Kingdom and the United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 
            1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion.[1] In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the 
            U.S. and most other developed countries.           
            The availability of various types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes, LaserDiscs, high-capacity hard disk drives, 
            CDs, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch 
            pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote 
            retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now also occurs on the cloud (such as the video-on-demand service by 
            Netflix). At the beginning of the 2010s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was 
            the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition 
            television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in different formats: 1080p, 
            1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television 
            programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, iPlayer and Hulu.           
            In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set.[2] The replacement of earlier cathode-ray tube (CRT) screen displays 
            with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), OLED displays, 
            and plasma displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most television sets sold in the 
            2000s were still CRT, it was only in early 2010s that flat-screen TVs decisively overtook CRT.[3] Major manufacturers announced the 
            discontinuation of CRT, Digital Light Processing (DLP), plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s.[4][5] LEDs are 
            being gradually replaced by OLEDs.[6] Also, major manufacturers have started increasingly producing smart TVs in the mid-2010s.
            [7][8][9] Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.
            [10][better source needed]            
            Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency television 
            transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively, television signals are distributed by coaxial 
            cable or optical fiber, satellite systems, and, since the 2000s, via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as 
            analog signals, but a transition to digital television was expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. A standard television 
            set consists of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. 
            A visual display device that lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.            
            The television broadcasts are mainly a simplex broadcast meaning that the transmitter cannot receive and the receiver cannot transmit.</i></b>

            <strong><em>A gaming computer, also known as a gaming PC, is a specialized personal computer designed for playing PC games at high standards. 
            They typically differ from mainstream personal computers by using high-performance graphics cards, a high core-count CPU with higher 
            raw performance and higher-performance RAM. Gaming PCs are also used for other demanding tasks such as video editing.[1] While often 
            in desktop form, gaming PCs may also be laptops or handhelds.Technically, any computer can be considered a "gaming computer"; however 
            the most common ones are typically based around an x86-based CPU with a graphics accelerator card, a sufficient amount of 
            high-performance RAM, and fast storage drives.
            In a desktop configuration, a case is also needed, and gaming cases are often modified or manufactured with extra LED lights or 
            see-through panels for aesthetic reasons.[18][19] Individual components are typically attached to a motherboard through different 
            bus slots, including the CPU, RAM, and graphics card, or wired to it with SATA or IDE cabling (for hard disks or optical drives).
            [20] Laptops also share a similar format, but with smaller and less power hungry components.
            Gamers and computer enthusiasts may choose to overclock their CPUs and GPUs in order to gain extra performance. The added power draw 
            needed to overclock either processing unit often requires additional cooling, usually by air cooling or water cooling.[21]
            These configurations mostly dates back to the 1990s when Intel and Microsoft first began to dominate the PC marketplace, and has not 
            changed significantly since then.[22] Hardware specs continue to improve over time due to the graphical demands of games, especially 
            with architectural and other changes within CPU and GPU designs.</em></strong>

            <em><strong>Red bananas are a group of varieties of bananas with reddish-purple skin. Some are smaller and plumper than the common Cavendish 
            banana, others much larger. Ripe, raw red bananas have a flesh that is creamy to light pink. They are also softer and sweeter than 
            the yellow Cavendish varieties, some with a slight tangy raspberry flavor and others with an earthy one. Many red bananas are 
            exported by producers in East Africa, Asia, South America, and the United Arab Emirates. They are a favorite in Central America,
            [1][2] but are sold throughout the world.Red bananas should have a deep red or maroon rind when ripe and are best eaten when 
            unbruised and slightly soft. This variety contains more beta-carotene and vitamin C than yellow bananas. It also contains 
            potassium and iron. The redder the fruit, the more carotene and the higher the vitamin C level.[3] As with yellow bananas, 
            red bananas will ripen in a few days at room temperature and are best stored outside from refrigeration.
            Compared with the most common banana, the Cavendish banana, they tend to be smaller, have a slightly thicker skin with a sweeter 
            taste, but do have a longer shelf life than yellow bananas.</strong></em>

            <strong><em>Pizza[a][1] is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped 
            with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
            The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border
            with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In 2009, Neapolitan 
            pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In 2017, the art of making 
            Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[8]
            Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including 
            pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[9] In Italy, pizza served 
            in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[10][11] In casual settings, however, it is 
            typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, 
            including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked using a home oven.
            In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[12] Overall, 
            13% of the US population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[13]</em></strong>

        <p>
            <strong><em>Cheesecake is a dessert made with a soft fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese, quark or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. 
            It may have a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.[1] 
            Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked, and is usually served chille
            Vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or other flavors may be added to the main cheese layer. Additional flavors and visual 
            appeal may be added by topping the finished dessert with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, or other 
            ingredients.Modern cheesecake is not usually classified as an actual "cake", despite the name (compare with Boston cream "pie").
            [14][15] Some people classify it as a torte due to the usage of many eggs, which are the sole source of leavening, as a key factor.
            [16][17] Others find compelling evidence that it is a custard pie,[15][18] based on the overall structure, with the separate crust, 
            the soft filling, and the absence of flour.[19][failed verification][20] Other sources identify it as a flan, or tart.[14][15][21]
            Smoked salmon cheesecake is a savoury form, containing smoked salmon.[22] It is most frequently served as an appetizer or a buffet 
            item.[23][24] A smoked salmon cheesecake was a prize-winning recipe in 1996 in Better Homes and Gardens' Prize Tested Recipe Contest. 
            The recipe called for the use of Swiss cheese along with the more usual (for cheesecakes) ricotta.[25]</em></strong>
