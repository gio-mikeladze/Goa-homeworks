<title>Javascript</title>
<h1>What is Javascript?</h1>
<p>JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]
Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<h2>the rise of JavaScript</h2>
<p>In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.
The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.[18]   
However, the effort to fully standardize the language was undermined by Microsoft gaining an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%.
[22] This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.
Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on ECMA work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.</p>
<h1>What is JavaScript used for?</h1>
<h2>Front-end web development</h2>
<p>Front-end developers use JavaScript (along with HTML and CSS) to create the parts of a web page that users see and interact with in their browsers.
Before JavaScript, web pages only served static content. JavaScript gave developers the ability to provide their users with a dynamic web experience, adding animations and other interactive elements. 
When you click a button on a website, and a side panel opens or a modal slowly comes into view, that’s JavaScript at work.
But JavaScript does more than that on the web. You can also use it to create single-page applications (or SPAs) that run on one HTML page to give users a smooth navigational experience.</p>
<h2>Back-end web development</h2>
<p>JavaScript is also popular with back-end developers. Back-end web development (also known as server-side development) involves creating the code that runs on a web server.
When a browser loads a web page, it makes a call to a remote server. Server-side code then parses the page’s URL to determine what the user is requesting before retrieving and transforming the required data to serve back to the browser.
Node.js is a JavaScript framework commonly used for back-end development — so much so that many back-end JavaScript developers refer to themselves as Node.js developers.

<h1>How long does it take to learn JavaScript?</h1>
<p>There’s no hard and fast answer to how long it takes to learn a language, in part because you’re never really finished learning. Like other languages, learning JavaScript can take a few months to a year.
All Codecademy courses and paths are crafted for self-guided learning, giving you the power to set a pace and schedule that fits your needs. 
Typically, we suggest investing anywhere from five to 15 hours each week in coding if you want to make a quick career change — though remember, everyone’s goals, lives, and schedules are unique.</p>
