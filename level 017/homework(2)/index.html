        <h1>1.Georgia</h1>
        <p>
         <i><b>Georgia[c] is a country in Eastern Europe and West Asia.[14][15][16] It is part of the Caucasus region, bounded by the Black Sea to the 
         west, Russia to the north and northeast, Turkey to the southwest, Armenia to the south, and Azerbaijan to the southeast. Georgia covers 
         an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi).[17] It has a population of 3.7 million,[d][18] of which over a third live in the 
         capital and largest city, Tbilisi. Georgians, who are native to the region, constitute a majority of the country's population and are its titular nation.
         Georgia has been inhabited since prehistory, hosting the world's earliest known sites of winemaking, gold mining, and textiles.[19][20] 
         The classical era saw the emergence of several kingdoms, such as Colchis and Iberia, that formed the nucleus of the modern Georgian state.
         In the early fourth century, Georgians officially adopted Christianity, which contributed to their unification under the Kingdom of 
         Georgia. Georgia reached its Golden Age during the High Middle Ages under the reigns of King David IV and Queen Tamar. Beginning in the 
         15th century, the kingdom declined and disintegrated under pressure from various regional powers, including the Mongols, the Ottoman 
         Empire, and Persia, before being gradually annexed into the Russian Empire starting in 1801.           
         After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia briefly emerged as an independent republic under German protection,[21] but was invaded and 
         annexed by the Red Army in 1921, becoming one of the republics of the Soviet Union. In the 1980s, an independence movement grew quickly, 
         leading to Georgia's secession from the Soviet Union in April 1991. For much of the subsequent decade, the country endured economic crises, political instability, 
         and secessionist wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Following the peaceful Rose Revolution in 2003, Georgia strongly pursued a 
         pro-Western foreign policy, introducing a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at integration into the European Union 
         and NATO. This Western orientation led to worsening relations with Russia, culminating in the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 and continued Russian occupation of parts of Georgia.           
         Georgia is a representative democracy governed as a unitary parliamentary republic.[22][23] It is a developing country with a very high 
         Human Development Index and an emerging market economy. Sweeping economic reforms since 2003 have resulted in one of the freest business 
         climates in the world, greater economic freedom and transparency, and among the fastest rates of GDP growth.[24] In 2018, Georgia became the 
         second country to legalize cannabis, and the first former socialist state to do so. Georgia is a member of numerous international 
         organizations, including the Council of Europe, Eurocontrol, BSEC, GUAM, Energy Community. As part of the Association Trio, Georgia is an
         official candidate for membership in the European Union.[25] Since October 2024, Georgia is immersed in a deep political crisis.</b></i>

            <b><i><u>The official name of the country is Georgia per Article 2 of the Georgian Constitution,[35] adopted in 1995. In Georgia's two official </u>
            languages (Georgian and Abkhaz), the country is named საქართველო (Sakartvelo) and Қырҭтәыла (Kərttʷʼəla) respectively. Prior to the adoption 
            of the Constitution in 1995 and following the dissolution of the USSR, the country was officially called the "Republic of Georgia".[36][37]
            Several languages continue to use the Russian variant of the country's name, Gruzia, which the Georgian authorities have sought to replace 
            hrough diplomatic campaigns. Since 2006, Israel,[38] Japan,[39] South Korea[40] and Hungary[41][42] officially changed their appellation of
            the country to variants of the English Georgia.[43] In 2020, Lithuania became the first country in the world to adopt Sakartvelas in all 
            official communications.[44]</i></b>

        <h2>Early Georgian kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia</h2>
        <p>
            <u>A second Georgian tribal union emerged on the Black Sea coast in the 13th century BC under the Kingdom of Colchis in western Georgia.
            [16][17] The kingdom of Colchis, which existed from the 6th to the 1st centuries BC is regarded as the first early Georgian state 
            formation and the term Colchians was used as the collective term for early Georgian-Kartvelian tribes such as Mingrelians, Lazs, and 
            Chans who populated the eastern coast of the Black Sea.[18][19][20][21][22][23][24]
            Colchis appears as the first Caucasian State to have achieved the coalescence of the newcomer, Colchis can be justly regarded as not 
            a proto-Georgian, but a Georgian (West Georgian) kingdom....It would seem natural to seek the beginnings of Georgian social history in 
            Colchis, the earliest Georgian formation.[25]</u>
            <i><b>The ancient Greeks knew of Colchis, and it featured in the Greek legend of Jason and the Argonauts, who travelled there in search of 
            the Golden Fleece. Starting around 2000 BC, northwestern Colchis was inhabited by the Svan and Zan peoples of the Kartvelian tribes. 
            Another important ethnic element of ancient Colchis were Greeks who between 1000 and 550 BC established many trading colonies in the 
            coastal area, among them Naessus, Pityus, Dioscurias (modern Sukhumi), Guenos, Phasis (modern Poti), Apsaros, and Rhizos (modern Rize 
            in Turkey). In the eastern part of Georgia, there was a struggle for the leadership among the various Georgian confederations during 
            the 6th–4th centuries BC, which was finally won by the Kartlian tribes from the region of Mtskheta. According to the Georgian tradition
            , the Kingdom of Kartli (known as Iberia in the Greek-Roman literature) was founded around 300 BC by Parnavaz I, the first ruler of the Parnavazid dynasty.[26]
            Between 653 and 333 BC, both Colchis and Iberia survived successive invasions by the Iranian Median Empire. The case is different for
            the Achaemenid Persians however.[27] According to Herodotus (3.97), Achaemenid power extended as far as the Caucasus mountains, but 
            the Colchians are not included in his list of the twenty Persian satrapies. Nor are they referred to in the lists of Achaemenid lands 
            (dahyāva) given in the Old Persian inscriptions of Darius and his successors.[27] In Xenophon's Anabasis 
            (7.8.25; probably an interpolation) the tribes of Colchis and East Pontus are referred to as independent (autónomoi). On the other 
            hand, Herodotus mentioned both the Colchians and various Pontic tribes in his catalogue (7.78–79) of approximately fifty-seven peoples
            who participated in Xerxes' expedition against Greece in 481–80 BC.[27] As the Encyclopaedia Iranica states, it is thus probable that
            the Achaemenids never succeeded in asserting effective rule over Colchis, though local tribal leaders seem to have acknowledged some
            kind of Persian suzerainty.[27] The Encyclopædia Iranica further states, whereas the adjoining Pontic tribes of the nineteenth 
            satrapy and the Armenians of the thirteenth are mentioned as having paid tribute to Persia, the Colchians and their Caucasian 
            neighbors are not; they had, however, undertaken to send gifts (100 boys and 100 girls) every five years (Herodotus 3.97).[27]
            At the end of the 4th century BC, southern Iberia witnessed the invading armies of Alexander the Great, who established a vast Greco-
            Macedonian empire to the south of the Caucasus. Neither Iberia nor Colchis was incorporated into the empire of Alexander or any of the 
            successor Hellenistic states of the Middle East.[27] However, the culture of ancient Greece still had a considerable influence on the
            region, and Greek was widely spoken in the cities of Colchis. In Iberia Greek influence was less noticeable and Aramaic was widely spoken.[27]
            Between the early 2nd century BC and the late 2nd century AD both Colchis and Iberia, together with the neighboring countries, became 
            an arena of long and devastating conflicts between major and local powers such as Rome, Armenia and the short-lived Kingdom of Pontus. 
            Pompey's campaign in 66–65 BC annexed Armenia and then he headed north along the Kura river and then west down the Rioni river to the Black Sea.
            [28] In 189 BC, the rapidly growing Kingdom of Armenia took over more than half of Iberia, conquering the southern and southeastern provinces of Gogarene, Taokhia and Heniochia, as well as some other territories. Between 120 and 63 BC, Armenia's ally Mithridate VI Eupator of Pontus conquered all of Colchis and incorporated it into his kingdom, embracing almost all of Asia Minor as well as the eastern and northern Black Sea coastal areas.

        <h1>2.France</h1>
        <p>
            <i><b>France,[IX] officially the French Republic,[X] is a country located primarily in Western Europe. Its overseas regions and territories 
            include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in 
            Oceania and the Indian Ocean, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France 
            shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the northeast, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the 
            southeast, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the northwest. Its metropolitan area 
            extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea. Its eighteen 
            integral regions—five of which are overseas—span a combined area of 632,702 km2 (244,288 sq mi) and have an estimated total population
            of over 68.6 million as of January 2025. France is a semi-presidential republic and its capital, largest city and main cultural and economic centre is Paris.
            Metropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to 
            a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Franks formed the kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the 
            Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the 
            High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralized feudal kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was 
            plunged into a dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century, French culture flourished during 
            the French Renaissance and a French colonial empire emerged. Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the House of 
            Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in the Thirty Years' War and further 
            increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.           
            The French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the 
            nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, 
            subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of 
            relative decline, in which France endured the Bourbon Restoration until the founding of the French Second Republic which was succeeded 
            by the Second French Empire upon Napoleon III's takeover. His empire collapsed during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. 
            This led to the establishment of the Third French Republic, and subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural 
            and scientific flourishing known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged 
            victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allies of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied in 1940. 
            Following its liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in 
            the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became 
            independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France.            
            France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the fourth-largest number 
            of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, having received 100 million foreign visitors in 2023. 
            A developed country, France has a high nominal per capita income globally, and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the 
            world by both nominal GDP and PPP-adjusted GDP. It is a great power, being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations 
            Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. The country is part of multiple international organizations and forums.</b></i>

        <h2>Frankish kingdoms (486–987)</h2>
        <p>
            <i><b><u>In 486, Clovis I, leader of the Salian Franks, defeated Syagrius at Soissons and subsequently united most of northern and central Gaul 
            under his rule. Clovis then recorded a succession of victories against other Germanic tribes such as the Alamanni at Tolbiac. In 496 
            Clovis started a war against the Goths in Aquitanië, which was mainly aimed for gathering loot. It took the Gothic king Alaric II two 
            years to push back the Franks. In 507 a second war started. This time Clovis defeated Alaric II at Vouillé and annexed Aquitaine, and 
            thus Toulouse, into his Frankish kingdom.[13] After his victory the pagan Clovis adopted Catholicism. This gave him greater 
            legitimacy and power over his Christian subjects and granted him clerical support against the Arian Visigoths.</u>
            Main article: Franco-Visigothic Wars
            The Goths retired to Toledo in what would become Spain. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty but 
            his kingdom would not survive his death in 511. Under Frankish inheritance traditions, all sons inherit part of the land, so four 
            kingdoms emerged: centered on Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. Over time, the borders and numbers of Frankish kingdoms were 
            fluid and changed frequently. Also during this time, the Mayors of the Palace, originally the chief advisor to the kings, would become
            the real power in the Frankish lands; the Merovingian kings themselves would be reduced to little more than figureheads.[13]           
            By this time Muslims had conquered Hispania and Septimania became part of the Al-Andalus, which were threatening the Frankish 
            kingdoms. Duke Odo the Great defeated a major invading force at Toulouse in 721 but failed to repel a raiding party in 732. 
            The mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated that raiding party at the Battle of Tours and earned respect and power within 
            the Frankish Kingdom. The assumption of the crown in 751 by Pepin the Short (son of Charles Martel) established the Carolingian 
            dynasty as the kings of the Franks.</b></i>

        <h1>3.spain</h1>
        <p>
            <i><b>Spain,[f] also the Kingdom of Spain,[a][g] is a country in southwestern Europe with territories in North Africa.[h] Featuring the 
            southernmost point of continental Europe, it is the largest country in Southern Europe and the fourth-most populous European Union 
            member state. Spanning across the majority of the Iberian Peninsula, its territory also includes the Canary Islands, in the Eastern 
            Atlantic Ocean, the Balearic Islands, in the Western Mediterranean Sea, and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, in Africa. 
            Peninsular Spain is bordered to the north by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; to the east and south by the Mediterranean Sea 
            and Gibraltar; and to the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid, and other major urban 
            areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza, Málaga, Murcia, and Palma de Mallorca.
            In early antiquity, the Iberian Peninsula was inhabited by Celts, Iberians, and other pre-Roman peoples. With the Roman conquest of 
            the Iberian peninsula, the province of Hispania was established. Following the Romanisation and Christianisation of Hispania, the 
            fall of the Western Roman Empire ushered in the inward migration of tribes from Central Europe, including the Visigoths, who formed 
            the Visigothic Kingdom centred on Toledo. In the early eighth century, most of the peninsula was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate,            
            and during early Islamic rule, Al-Andalus became a dominant peninsular power centred on Córdoba. The several Christian kingdoms that 
            emerged in Northern Iberia, chief among them Asturias, León, Castile, Aragon and Navarre, made an intermittent southward military 
            expansion and repopulation, known as the Reconquista, repelling Islamic rule in Iberia, which culminated with the Christian seizure 
            of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in 1492. The dynastic union of the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1479 under the Catholic
            Monarchs is often considered the de facto unification of Spain as a nation state.            
            During the Age of Discovery, Spain pioneered the exploration and conquest of the New World, made the first circumnavigation of the 
            globe and formed one of the largest empires in history.[11] The Spanish Empire reached a global scale and spread across all continents,
            underpinning the rise of a global trading system fueled primarily by precious metals. In the 18th century, the Bourbon Reforms, 
            particularly the Nueva Planta decrees, centralized mainland Spain, strengthening royal authority and modernizing administrative 
            structures.[12] In the 19th century, after the victorious Peninsular War against Napoleonic occupation forces, the following 
            political divisions between liberals and absolutists led to the breakaway of most of the American colonies. 
            These political divisions finally converged in the 20th century with the Spanish Civil War, giving rise to the Francoist 
            dictatorship that lasted until 1975. With the restoration of democracy and its entry into the European Union, the country 
            experienced an economic boom that profoundly transformed it socially and politically. Since the Spanish Golden Age, Spanish 
            art, architecture, music, poetry, painting, literature, and cuisine have been influential worldwide, particularly in Western 
            Europe and the Americas. As a reflection of its large cultural wealth, Spain is the world's second-most visited country, has 
            one of the world's largest numbers of World Heritage Sites, and it is the most popular destination for European students.[13] 
            Its cultural influence extends to over 600 million Hispanophones, making Spanish the world's second-most spoken native language 
            and the world's most widely spoken Romance language.[14]            
            Spain is a secular parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy,[15] with King Felipe VI as head of state. A developed 
            country, it is a major advanced capitalist economy,[16] with the world's fifteenth-largest by both nominal GDP and PPP-adjusted 
            GDP. It is also currently the fourth largest economy in the European Union. Spain is a member of the United Nations, the European
            Union, the eurozone, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), a permanent guest of the G20, and is part of many other 
            international organisations such as the Council of Europe (CoE), the Organisation of Ibero-American States (OEI), the Union 
            for the Mediterranean, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Organisation for Security and 
            Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</b></i>

        <h2>History of Spain</h2>
        <p>
            <i><b>the history of Spain dates to contact between the pre-Roman peoples of the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula with the Greeks
            and Phoenicians. During Classical Antiquity, the peninsula was the site of multiple successive colonizations of Greeks, Carthaginians,
            and Romans. Native peoples of the peninsula, such as the Tartessos, intermingled with the colonizers to create a uniquely Iberian 
            culture. The Romans referred to the entire peninsula as Hispania, from which the name "Spain" originates. As was the rest of the 
            Western Roman Empire, Spain was subject to numerous invasions of Germanic tribes during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, resulting in 
            the end of Roman rule and the establishment of Germanic kingdoms, marking the beginning of the Middle Ages in Spain.
            Germanic control lasted until the Umayyad conquest of Hispania began in 711. The region became known as Al-Andalus, and except for 
            the small Kingdom of Asturias, the region remained under the control of Muslim-led states for much of the Early Middle Ages, a period 
            known as the Islamic Golden Age. By the time of the High Middle Ages, Christians from the north gradually expanded their control over 
            Iberia, a period known as the Reconquista. As they expanded southward, a number of Christian kingdoms were formed, including the 
            Kingdom of Navarre, the Kingdom of León, the Kingdom of Castile, and the Kingdom of Aragon. They eventually consolidated into two 
            roughly equivalent polities, the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon. The early modern period is generally dated from the union 
            of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon by royal marriage in 1469.                
            The joint rule of Isabella I and Ferdinand II is historiographically considered the foundation of a unified Spain. The conquest of 
            Granada, and the first voyage of Columbus, both in 1492, made that year a critical inflection point in Spanish history. The voyages 
            of the explorers and conquistadors of Spain during the subsequent decades helped establish a Spanish colonial empire which was among 
            the largest ever. King Charles I established the Spanish Habsburg dynasty. Under his son Philip II the Spanish Golden Age flourished, 
            the Spanish Empire reached its territorial and economic peak, and his palace at El Escorial became the center of artistic flourishing. 
            However, Philip's rule also saw the destruction of the Spanish Armada, a number of state bankruptcies and the independence of the 
            Northern Netherlands, which marked the beginning of the slow decline of Spanish influence in Europe. Spain's power was further tested 
            by its participation in the Eighty Years' War, whereby it tried and failed to recapture the newly independent Dutch Republic, and the 
            Thirty Years' War, which resulted in continued decline of Habsburg power in favor of the French Bourbon dynasty. Matters came to a head
            with the death of the last Habsburg ruler Charles II of Spain; the War of the Spanish Succession broke out between two European 
            alliances led by the French Bourbons and the Austrian Habsburgs, for the control of the Spanish throne. The Bourbons prevailed,
            resulting in the ascension of Philip V of Spain, who took Spain into various wars and eventually recaptured the territories in 
            southern Italy that had been lost in the War of the Spanish Succession. Spain's late entry into the Seven Years' War was the 
            result of fear of the growing successes of the British at the expense of the French, but Spanish forces suffered major defeats. 
            Motivated by this and earlier setbacks during Bourbon rule, Spanish institutions underwent a period of reform, especially under 
            Charles III, that culminated in Spain's largely successful involvement in the American War of Independence.
            During the Napoleonic era, Spain became a French puppet state. Concurrent with, and following, the Napoleonic period the Spanish 
            American wars of independence resulted in the loss of most of Spain's territory in the Americas in the 1820s. During the 
            re-establishment of the Bourbon rule in Spain, constitutional monarchy was introduced in 1813. Spain's history during the nineteenth 
            century was tumultuous, and featured alternating periods of republican-liberal and monarchical rule. The Spanish–American War led to 
            losses of Spanish colonial possessions and a series of military dictatorships, during which King Alfonso XIII was deposed and a new 
            Republican government was formed. Ultimately, the political disorder within Spain led to a coup by the military which led to the 
            Spanish Civil War. After much foreign intervention on both sides, the Nationalists emerged victorious; Francisco Franco led a fascist 
            dictatorship for almost four decades. Franco's death ushered in a return of the monarchy under King Juan Carlos I, which saw a 
            liberalization of Spanish society and a re-engagement with the international community. A new liberal Constitution was established in 
            1978. Spain entered the European Economic Community in 1986 (transformed into the European Union in 1992), and the Eurozone in 1998. 
            Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014, and was succeeded by his son Felipe VI.</b></i>
