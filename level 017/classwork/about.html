        <h1>What is football?</h1>
        <p>
            <i><b>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players who almost 
            exclusively use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals 
            than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally,
            the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in 
            over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.
            Association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by
            the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to score goals
            by getting the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line). When the ball is in 
            play, the players mainly use their feet, but may also use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, 
            strike, or pass the ball; the head, chest, and thighs are commonly used. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and that 
            only within the penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. Depending on the format of the 
            competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared with 1 point awarded to each team, or the game may go 
            into extra time or a penalty shoot-out.[5]           
            Internationally, association football is governed by FIFA. Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, 
            CONMEBOL, OFC, and UEFA. National associations (e.g. the FA in England, U.S. Soccer in the United States, etc.) are responsible for 
            managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating competitions in accordance with
            the Laws of the Game. The most prestigious senior international competition is the FIFA World Cup. The men's World Cup is the most-viewed 
            sporting event in the world, surpassing the Olympic Games.[6] The most prestigious competition in European club football is the UEFA 
            Champions League, which attracts an extensive television audience worldwide. The final of the men's Champions League is the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[7][8]</b></i>

            <i><b>Association football is part of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. 
            The word "association" in this term refers to the Football Association (the FA), founded in London in 1863, which published the 
            first set of rules for the sport that same year.[9] The term was coined to distinguish the type of football played in accordance 
            with the FA rules from other types that were gaining popularity at the time, particularly rugby football.[10]
            Within the English-speaking world, association football is now usually called simply "football" in Great Britain and most of Ulster 
            in the north of Ireland,[11] whereas people usually call it "soccer" in regions and countries where other codes of football are 
            prevalent, such as Australia,[12] Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster),[13] and the United States. A notable 
            exception is New Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, 
            "football" has been gaining prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby union and rugby league.[14]
            The term soccer comes from Oxford "-er" slang, which was prevalent at the University of Oxford in England from about 1875, and is 
            thought to have been borrowed from the slang of Rugby School. Initially spelt assoccer (a shortening of "association"), it was later 
            reduced to the modern spelling.[15][16] This form of slang also gave rise to rugger for rugby football, fiver and tenner for five 
            pound and ten pound notes, and the now-archaic footer that was also a name for association football.[17] The word soccer arrived at 
            its current form in 1895, having been recorded previously as socca in 1889 and as socker in 1891.[10]</b></i>

        <h2>history</h2>
        <p>
            <b><i>Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures.[b] The Chinese competitive game cuju 
            (蹴鞠, literally "kickball"; also known as tsu chu) resembles modern association football as well as a mix of basketball and volleyball.
            [19][20] This is the earliest form of a kicking game for which there is historical evidence. The game was first recorded as in exercise            
            in the Zhan Guo Ce, a military history from the Han dynasty.[21] Cuju players would pass the ball around, having to avoid it touching 
            the ground at any point. It was then passed to a designated player, who attempted to kick it through the fengliu yan, a circular goal 
            atop 10–11 meter poles.[19] During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.[22] 
            The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of cuju outside of China, especially the form of the game popular in the Tang dynasty, the 
            period when the inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball.[23] Other East Asian games include kemari in Japan and 
            chuk-guk in Korea, both influenced by cuju.[24][25] Kemari originated after the year 600 during the Asuka period. It was a ceremonial
            rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking of a mari, a ball made of animal skin.[26] In North America, pasuckuakohowog 
            was a ball game played by the Algonquians; it was described as "almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at 
            the same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals".[27]
            Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games.[21][28] An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a stele of c. 375–400
            BCE in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens[18] appears on the UEFA European Championship trophy.[29] Athenaeus, writing in 
            228 CE, mentions the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all 
            appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling, and volleyball more than what is recognisable as modern football.[22][30][31][32][33][34]</i></b>
