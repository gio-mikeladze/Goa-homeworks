            <b><i>Red bananas are a group of varieties of bananas with reddish-purple skin. Some are smaller and plumper than the common Cavendish banana,
            others much larger. Ripe, raw red bananas have a flesh that is creamy to light pink. They are also softer and sweeter than the yellow
            Cavendish varieties, some with a slight tangy raspberry flavor and others with an earthy one. Many red bananas are exported by producers
            in East Africa, Asia, South America, and the United Arab Emirates. They are a favorite in Central America,[1][2] but are sold throughout the world</b></i>

            A mouse designed for gamers. Gaming mice have adjustable sensitivity, which is configurable as the number of dots per inch (DPI).
            The greater the DPI, the farther the cursor moves on screen with the same amount of mouse movement. In general, a higher DPI setting
            (1000 DPI and more) is used for gaming as well as for monitors with very high resolution. However, in a video game, the higher DPI may
            help or hinder depending on the zoom level of the scene. Higher DPI lets the gamer make quick movements, while lower DPI allows for smaller, precise movements. See DPI, gaming PC and gaming keyboard.

            A gaming computer, also known as a gaming PC, is a specialized personal computer designed for playing PC games at high standards.
            They typically differ from mainstream personal computers by using high-performance graphics cards, a high core-count CPU with higher
            raw performance and higher-performance RAM. Gaming PCs are also used for other demanding tasks such as video editing.[1] While often
            in desktop form, gaming PCs may also be laptops or handhelds.

            A gaming chair is a type of chair marketed towards gamers.[1][2] They differ from most office chairs in having high backrest designed
            to support the upper back and shoulders.[3] Like many office chairs, they are customizable: the armrests, back, lumbar support and
            headrest can all be adjusted for comfort and efficiency.[3] However, there are criticisms of gaming chairs. For example, they tend
            to be designed and marketed primarily for aesthetics at the expense of having worse ergonomics than modern office chairs.[4]

            The iPad is a brand of iOS- and iPadOS-based tablet computers that are developed and marketed by Apple. The first-generation iPad was
            introduced on January 27, 2010. Since then, the iPad product line has been expanded to include the smaller iPad Mini, the lighter and
            thinner iPad Air, and the flagship iPad Pro models. As of 2022, over 670 million iPads have been sold, making Apple the largest vendor
            of tablet computers. Due to its popularity, the term "iPad" is sometimes used as a generic name for tablet computers.
            The iPhone's iOS operating system (OS) was initially used for the iPad, but in September 2019, its OS was switched to a fork of iOS
            called iPadOS that has better support for the device's hardware and a user interface tailored to the tablets' larger screens. Since
            then, major versions of iPadOS have been released annually. The iPad's App Store is subject to application and content approval. Many
            older devices are susceptible to jailbreaking, which circumvents these restrictions.  
            The original iPad was well-received for its software and was recognized as one of the most-influential inventions of 2010. As of the
            third quarter of 2021, the iPad had a market share of 34.6% among tablets. Beside personal use, the iPad is used in the business,
            education, healthcare, and technology sectors. There are two connectivity variants of iPad; one has only Wi-Fi, and one has additional
            support for cellular networks. Accessories for the iPad include the Apple Pencil, Smart Case, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio,
            Magic Keyboard, and several adapters.

            <i><b>The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was announced as the successor
            to the PlayStation 4 in April 2019, was launched on November 12, 2020, in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South
            Korea, and was released worldwide a week later. The PS5 is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles, along with
            Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S consoles, which were released in the same month.
            The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The Digital Edition lacks this drive, as a
            lower-cost model for buying games only through download. The two variants were launched simultaneously. Slimmer hardware revisions
            of both models replaced the original models on sale in November 2023.[10] A PlayStation 5 Pro model was released on November 7, 2024,
            featuring a faster GPU, improved ray tracing, and introducing an AI-driven upscaling technology.                
            The PlayStation 5's main hardware features include a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant
            improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of 4K resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, hardware-accelerated
            ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections, and the Tempest Engine for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects.
            Other features include the DualSense controller with haptic feedback, backward compatibility with the majority of PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games, and the PlayStation VR2 headset.

            Television (TV) is a telecommunication medium for transmitting moving images and sound. Additionally, the term can refer to a physical
            television set rather than the medium of transmission. Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports.
            The medium is capable of more than "radio broadcasting," which refers to an audio signal sent to radio receivers.
            Television became available in crude experimental forms in the 1920s, but only after several years of further development was the new
            technology marketed to consumers. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in
            the United Kingdom and the United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the
            1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion.[1] In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced
            in the U.S. and most other developed countries.

            An excellent wired gaming headset will bring us every game sound perfect, no matter if it is on a mobile device or console. And besides
            the excellent audio quality, it also allows us to engage in chat audio. An excellent wired gaming headset comes with great audio
            quality and a high-frequency range. Many gaming headsets offer the noise-canceling feature too, which uses tiny microphones that
            listen to the outside noise around you. These noises are then analyzed by microchips in the gaming headset, and a counter-signal
            that cancels out the noise is produced. You can check the Wellyp Gaming headset WGH-V10 to have a clear idea.

            A microphone, colloquially called a mic (/maɪk/),[1] or mike,[a] is a transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal.
            Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public events,
            motion picture production, live and recorded audio engineering, sound recording, two-way radios, megaphones, and radio and television
            broadcasting. They are also used in computers and other electronic devices, such as mobile phones, for recording sounds, speech
            recognition, VoIP, and other purposes, such as ultrasonic sensors or knock sensors.
            Several types of microphone are used today, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a sound wave
            to an electrical signal. The most common are the dynamic microphone, which uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the
            condenser microphone, which uses the vibrating diaphragm as a capacitor plate; and the contact microphone, which uses a crystal of
            piezoelectric material. Microphones typically need to be connected to a preamplifier before the signal can be recorded or reproduced.
