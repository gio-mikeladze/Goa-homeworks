        <h1>my favourite pet dog</h1>     
        <h2>What is dog?</h2>
        <p>Domestic dogs evolved from wolves—either grey wolves or another, now-extinct type of wolf—though there is some scientific debate about their exact origin. Genetics suggest that dogs broke off from their wild ancestors between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago and became domesticated through human interactions.
        There are over 400 dog breeds, but every variation is a member of the same species, Canis lupus familiaris, and all are related to other wild canines, like foxes.   
        Dogs come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from huge Great Danes to tiny teacup Chihuahuas. Dog weights range wildly from 1.8 kilograms (4 pounds) for toy poodles to 104 kilograms (230 pounds) for the largest mastiffs.
        Humans used simple forms of genetic engineering to breed dogs for specific instincts and characteristics, and the first domestic dogs were likely bred for hunting.    
        Today, many people keep pet dogs for companionship and comfort, though there are still many modern jobs for dogs, from providing services to individuals to sniffing out wildlife crime.
        Unfortunately, feral dogs can wreak havoc in their local ecosystems, primarily by preying on native wildlife, leading to severe population declines.</p>
        <h2>Where do dogs live?</h2>
        <p>Dogs are now found all over the world. Their ancestors, grey wolves, were originally found throughout the northern hemisphere and were the world’s most widely distributed mammal at one point.</p>
        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>The evolution of dogs from grey wolves occurred over thousands of years through a combination of natural selection and human influence.
        Research shows that the first domesticated wolves occurred between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago. 
        The exact timeline and details of this domestication process are still debated among scientists, 
        as there were likely several unique instances of wolves being domesticated in different parts of the world at different times.   
        Around 20,000 to 40,000 years ago, it is believed that humans and grey wolves started developing a mutually beneficial relationship. 
        Different packs of wolves, in different geographical areas, entered this relationship in different ways. 
        For example, wolves in northern Eurasia likely had a hand in their own domestication by following around nomadic people and eating the 
        remains of animals and other food scraps these people left behind. 
        Over time, a form of natural selection occurred. Wolves that were more tolerant of humans and were less aggressive would have 
        been more likely to thrive in this new environment. 
        As wild animals, it’s unclear exactly how wolves became comfortable sharing space with humans. 
        However, once they did, humans began to breed them, using simple forms of genetic engineering to breed for specific instincts and characteristics.
        The first dogs were likely bred for hunting, herding livestock, working and towing sledges in the cold, and protection. 
        For example, huskies were bred to withstand cold temperatures, German shepherds to herd livestock, 
        and dachshunds for their ability to chase badgers into burrows.
        As human societies developed and diversified, so did the roles assigned to dogs, 
        and different breeds emerged based on specific needs and preferences. Selective breeding by humans further accentuated certain physical and behavioral traits, resulting in the wide variety of dog breeds we have today.</p>
